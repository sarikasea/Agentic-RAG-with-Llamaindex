            "\u001b[0mMetaGPT is introduced as a meta-programming framework designed for multi-agent collaboration using large language models (LLMs). It incorporates Standardized Operating Procedures (SOPs) into prompt sequences, streamlining workflows and enabling agents with domain expertise to verify intermediate results, thus reducing errors. By using an assembly line paradigm, MetaGPT assigns diverse roles to agents, breaking down complex tasks into subtasks that require collaboration. The framework's effectiveness is demonstrated through collaborative software engineering benchmarks, where it generates more coherent solutions compared to previous chat-based multi-agent systems. The design of MetaGPT improves robustness, reduces unproductive collaboration among LLM-based agents, and elevates code generation quality through a novel executive feedback mechanism that debugs and executes code during runtime.\n",
